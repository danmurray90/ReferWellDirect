## Recent Achievements (Latest Sprint)

### Core Matching Engine Implementation
- ‚úÖ **Vector Embedding Service**: Sentence-Transformers integration with pgvector support
- ‚úÖ **BM25 Service**: TF-IDF based lexical search with configurable parameters
- ‚úÖ **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines vector similarity and BM25 with weighted scoring
- ‚úÖ **Probability Calibration**: Isotonic regression and Platt scaling for confidence scoring
- ‚úÖ **Structured Reranking**: Specialism, language, age group, and experience matching
- ‚úÖ **Management Commands**: `update_embeddings` and `test_matching` for system management
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with mocked dependencies

### Technical Features
- **Hybrid Search**: 70% vector similarity + 30% BM25 lexical search
- **Calibrated Probabilities**: Brier score and reliability curve metrics
- **Audit Trail**: Detailed match explanations for transparency
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient embedding updates for large datasets
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services fail

## Next Actions
1. Implement threshold routing to High-Touch queue
2. Add performance optimization and caching
3. Create comprehensive test suite
4. Add advanced UI features
5. Set up production configuration
