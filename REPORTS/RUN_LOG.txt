FAILURES BY CATEGORY:
====================

1. Lint/Type/Format Issues:
   - 141 ruff errors (mostly unused imports)
   - 942 mypy errors (type annotations, undefined names)

2. Django Runtime Issues:
   - NameError: 'Task' is not defined in referrals/views.py:49
   - NameError: 'Task' is not defined in referrals/views.py:73
   - Missing import: get_object_or_404 in catalogue/views.py:256
   - Missing import: MatchingService in matching/views.py:297

3. Unit Test Failures:
   - 26 test failures across multiple modules
   - Main issues: missing imports, undefined names, test data conflicts
   - Mock/patch issues with external dependencies

4. Runtime/Smoke Issues:
   - Dashboard views failing due to missing Task import
   - API endpoints returning 403/400 errors due to missing imports
   - Test data conflicts (duplicate usernames)

TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER CLASSIFICATION:
=====================================

Overdue for Current Stage:
- Fix missing imports (Task, get_object_or_404, MatchingService)
- Resolve undefined names in views
- Fix test data conflicts

Not Due Yet (Future Stage):
- Advanced type annotations (mypy strict mode)
- Comprehensive linting cleanup
- Production deployment configuration

Unknown (Needs Human):
- Mock/patch issues with external dependencies
- Some test failures may require deeper investigation

EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY FOUND (KEPT):
=================================
- Comprehensive notification system
- Advanced search and filtering
- Bulk operations
- Reporting and analytics
- API documentation
- Premium design system
- Real-time notifications
- User onboarding flow
- Core matching engine with vector embeddings

NEXT ACTIONS REQUIRING NON-MINIMAL CHANGES:
===========================================
- Fix missing imports and undefined names
- Resolve test data conflicts
- Address mock/patch issues
- Clean up unused imports (can be automated)
- Add missing type annotations (can be gradual)
