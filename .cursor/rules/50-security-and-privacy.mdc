- No PHI in emails/SMS. Notifications are in-app; emails become nudges at a later milestone.
- Structured logging with redaction; never log tokens or free-text notes.
- RBAC by role + organisation; immutable AuditEvent on every state change.
- Records & retention hooks (jobs but no destructive deletes until final milestone; soft-delete flags OK).
