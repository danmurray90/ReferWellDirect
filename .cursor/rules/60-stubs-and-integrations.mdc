- GOV.UK Notify client wrapper: build interface + fake backend for tests. (Docs linked for later enablement)
- Payments: Stripe Connect flow as interface + fake collector; no network calls now. (Destination charges/app fee later)
- Identity: OIDC adapters for NHS login/CIS2 as stubs. All OFF by default with settings flags and “Not enabled” banners in UI.
