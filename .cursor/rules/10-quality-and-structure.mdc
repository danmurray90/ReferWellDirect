# Structure
- Apps: accounts, catalogue, referrals, matching, inbox, payments (stubs), ops.
- Keep services/functions pure where possible; DB writes at edges.
- Add ADRs for significant decisions under /ADR.

# Testing
- pytest + pytest-django; factory_boy; freezegun.
- Aim for tests on models, services (matching, feasibility filter, calibration).
- Provide sample data fixtures for local dev.

# Docs & tracking
- Update README.md with run steps; keep “Known gaps” list.
- Update PROJECT_MILESTONES.md checkboxes and OPEN_TASKS.md after changes.
