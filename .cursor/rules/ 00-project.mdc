# ReferWell Direct — Core Context

- Tech: Django + DRF; Postgres + PostGIS + pgvector; Redis; Celery; server-rendered templates (NHS.UK styling later).
- Local-only MVP; all external services are STUBBED behind feature flags.
- Users: GP, Patient, Psychologist, High-Touch Referrer (admin).
- Non-negotiables: accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA minded), auditability, privacy by default, no PHI in emails; notifications are in-app with email nudges only at later milestone.

# Working agreements for the Agent
- Always operate in PLAN → ACT cycles. Keep PROJECT_MILESTONES.md and OPEN_TASKS.md updated on every step.
- Decompose work into small PR-sized commits (use Conventional Commits).
- Write tests for core domain logic before or alongside code; maintain fast feedback.
- Never call real external APIs; implement adapters with feature flags OFF and deterministic fakes for tests.
